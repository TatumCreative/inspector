# How to Build and Inspector

This is a personal experiment on how to build an inspector, and an experiment to see what an inspector's state data structure could look like. Currently there's no real UI, just a big dump in the console of what was parsed. The data structure is at the end, with tables in between.

## Article

As I'm programming this experiment, I'm writing a series of articles to go with it. They are still in the draft stage, as I would like to get them reviewed, and take my code along a bit further to make sure what I'm doing isn't fundamentally flawed.
