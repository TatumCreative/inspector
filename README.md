# How to Build a CSS Inspector

This is a personal experiment on how to build a CSS inspector, and a prototype of what an inspector's state data structure could look like.

* Locally: From terminal run `npm install` and then `npm start`.

As I'm programming this experiment, I'm writing a series of articles to go with it. They are still in the draft stage, as I would like to get them reviewed, and take my code along a bit further to make sure what I'm doing isn't fundamentally flawed.
